# Advanced Data Structures in Python

Basic implementation of advanced data structures in python.I usually use these for my coding problems on hackerrank, leetcode, pramp etc.

Needs to be tested for use in programming contest environment.

## Implemented:
1. AVL Trees
2. Fenwich Trees / BIT Tree
3. Balanced Binary Search Tree

## To be implemented:
1. Segment trees
2. KDTrees
3. Interval trees
4. Red-Black trees
5. Suffix tries

## Getting started
It is not published as a package now, so just copy and paste it, import it and use it as per normal.
Head on over to my repl repos to run these code in an interactive coding environment online!
